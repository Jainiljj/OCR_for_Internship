# OCR_for_Internship
This project is an automated document processing tool designed to extract structured data from semi-structured documents (specifically invoices). It uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to convert image data into text and Regex-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify key entities like dates, invoice numbers, and line items.
